# HDL-Lift-Controller-System

### Problem Statement
Design a Lift Controller using HDL for 14 storied building. The lift operates such that if the destination floor is odd number, it will stop for 4 times the floor number time units, otherwise for even number, it should stop for 7 times the floor number time units. If the lift reached ground floor (floor = 0) or the top floor ( floor = 14), music should stop playing, else it should keep playing music. The floor it is travelling should be denoted by LED glowing. It should remember the current floor and go to the next floor accordingly.
